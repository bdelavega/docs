# On Catholicism, Specifically


This ideology was and is very successful as a meme or set of memes. It has 1+ billion adherents.

Yet it seems outdated. If everyone fucked without birth control we would exceed the carrying capacity of the Earth within 10 or so years.

Sadly, modern Catholics are almost in a death cult. Long ago this was a successful meme because there was lots of space to move into. But now people cover the planet.

This is probably why Elon Musk sounds like an asshole. He is Catholic in his desire to procreate. His ideology can only be supported if we expand - e.g. by colonizing Mars.

# On Taxes

Because income is distributed in a power law, marginal tax rates should also be distributed in a power law.

Below 1000, you don't pay. 
from 1001 to 10,000 you pay 0.5%
from 10,001 to 100,000 - 5%
from 100,001 to 1,000,000 - 40%
from 1,000,001 to 10,000,000 - 50%
from 10,000,001 to 100,000,000 - 70%
over 100,000,001 - 85%

Additionally having a savings amount bumps you up this way:
from 1M - 10M increase income by 10k
above 10M - +20 on income
