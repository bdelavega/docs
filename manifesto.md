# On Catholicism, Specifically


This ideology was and is very successful as a meme or set of memes. It has 1+ billion adherents.

Yet it seems outdated. If everyone fucked without birth control we would exceed the carrying capacity of the Earth within 10 or so years.

Sadly, modern Catholics are almost in a death cult. Long ago this was a successful meme because there was lots of space to move into. But now people cover the planet.

This is probably why Elon Musk sounds like an asshole. He is Catholic in his desire to procreate. His ideology can only be supported if we expand - e.g. by colonizing Mars.
